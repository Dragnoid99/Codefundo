There are various problems faced by Countries and we need to find the solutions of such problems. The following are the efforts of the same-
1. Some people live in hilly areas, they have to travel several miles to reach the voting destination. Also, because of so much travelling many people don't go to vote. Also some people don't go because there is a long line to vote so, it takes too much time. Instead of offline voting, one should use Azure Blockchain to do safe online voting so that it is comfortable to everyone.
2. The official age for voting is 18 years, but when one becomes 18 years old, then he/she starts to apply for Voter card and it additionally takes half year to make it, so azure blockchain can be used to secure the information, and make sure it takes much less time for this process.
3. The online voting is too vulnerable to hackers so, one should use azure blockchain to secure the voting and prevent results to be tampered with.
